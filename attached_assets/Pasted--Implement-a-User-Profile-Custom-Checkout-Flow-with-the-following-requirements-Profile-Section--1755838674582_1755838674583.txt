"Implement a User Profile & Custom Checkout Flow with the following requirements:

Profile Section

When the user clicks their avatar in the navbar, redirect them to a Profile page.

On this page, allow users to add/edit their delivery details and phone number (used for WhatsApp contact).

Fields should include:

Full Name

Phone Number (WhatsApp)

Address Line 1

Address Line 2 (optional)

City

Postal Code

Save these details in a new user_profile table linked to the user.

Table Example: user_profile

id (PK)

user_id (FK → users)

full_name

phone_number

address_line_1

address_line_2

city

postal_code

created_at, updated_at

Checkout Flow

When the user proceeds to checkout, redirect them to a Checkout page (not the cart slider).

If the user already has delivery details saved in their profile, prefill those fields automatically.

If no details are saved, force them to fill out the form during checkout.

After checkout, store the order details in an orders table.

Table Example: orders

id (PK)

user_id (FK → users)

cart_items (JSON or separate order_items table with order_id, product_id, quantity, price)

delivery_address (snapshot of user’s address at order time)

phone_number (snapshot at order time)

status (pending, confirmed, shipped, delivered)

created_at, updated_at

WhatsApp Contact Flow (No Card Payment)

Instead of online payment, once the user completes checkout, show a confirmation page.

On confirmation, generate a summary of the order + delivery details.

Provide a button/link to contact the seller directly via WhatsApp using the phone number saved in the profile.

The WhatsApp link should pre-fill a message with order details (products, total, delivery address).

Best Practices

Ensure profile updates are editable anytime by the user.

Make sure order records save a snapshot of the delivery details (so if a user later changes their profile, old orders still keep the original address).

Keep the checkout flow simple, clear, and mobile-friendly.
